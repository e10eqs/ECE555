Running Artist Hierarchical Netlisting ...

WARNING (OSSHNL-325): Place master 'ECE555/INV/symbol' for instance 'INV' has been modified since the last
extraction of its parent cellview 'ECE555/AND2/schematic'.
Connectivity changes in the place master can cause issues in the generated
netlist. To resolve such issues:
-Reextract the parent cellview 'ECE555/AND2/schematic' and regenerate the netlist. To avoid
multiple Check and Save operations, use the Check Hierarchy form or the
schHiCheckHier SKILL function to do a hierarchical check and save on the top
cell and then generate the netlist.
-Ignore all connectivity checks for this place master by specifying it to the
list of cellviews to be ignored using the hnlUserIgnoreCVModifyList variable.
-Change the severity of modification errors by setting the environment variable
simSymbolModifiedAction to 'ignore'. However, this may ignore both connectivity
and non-connectivity changes, thereby generating an incorrect netlist.
To avoid reporting of non-connectivity changes after performing a hierarchical
check and save operation, set 'schematic' 'autoEquivalentConnectivityTime' to
't' in the .cdsenv file. After setting the autoEquivalentConnectivityTime
variable, set simSymbolModifiedAction to 'error' to receive reports of only
connectivity issues during netlisting.
The variable simSymbolModifiedAction controls the severity of this message,
which can be 'ignore', 'warning', or 'error'.
